Documentation
=============

Zikula Core is in transition.

In this folder, you will find both Core-1.x docs and Core-2.0 docs. BOTH sets of docs are useful with the current
release of Zikula Core. While the current release is in the 1.x series, the Core-2.0 directory contains documentation
of features that are currently implemented in the Core-1.x series that will be maintained into the Core-2.0 release.
These Core-2.0 features and methods are the "new" preferred methods. Where conflicts exist between the two sets
of docs, you should use the Core-2.0 methods where possible.

The **Admin** directory is also Core-2.0 related Docs that are already available and will be maintained into Core-2.0.
These docs are intended specifically for site admins.
